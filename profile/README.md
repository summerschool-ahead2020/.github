# AHEAD2020 High-Resolution X-ray Spectroscopy School

This is the organization page for the [AHEAD2020 High-Resolution X-ray Spectroscopy School in Alicante, Spain,
held on May 22-25, 2023](https://webserver.javalab.ua.es/ahead2020/schools/ahead2020-high-resolution-x-ray-spectroscopy-school).

High resolution spectroscopy is a fundamental tool in X-ray Astrophysics. It provides unique plasma diagnostics in a wide range of astrophysical contexts, from clusters of galaxies to solar system bodies. Current grating-based spectrometers (XMM-RGS, Chandra HETG) provide the highest spectral resolution achievable today. Calorimeters (XRISM, X-IFU) will increase the resolution to unprecedented levels opening a new era of X-ray astrophysics that will expand our knowledge of the high energy Universe.

AHEAD2020 aims to provide young astronomers with the specific theoretical and practical skills to successfully exploit the current and future generation of X-ray instruments. To this end, world class experts in various fields will deliver lectures and conduct hands-on sessions, including the analysis of real calorimeter data. Students will have the opportunity to interact with renowned scientists in a highly motivating environment.

This Github organization contains the materials for the hands-on sessions offered during the school. Feel free to use these materials for your
own purpose. These session materials can be cited using their Zenodo upload. Our 
[Zenodo community page](https://zenodo.org/communities/ahead2020_alicante) contains an overview of all uploads, including presentations.

The [hands-on sessions website](https://summerschool-ahead2020.github.io/hands-on-sessions/index.html) contains a human readable overview of all 
the available sessions with exercise descriptions.
